Arithmetic
==========

Animated and interactive math game where the "true substance" is the only thing that exists,
but it can adopt an infinite number forms. These forms are what we call arithmetic. By observing
and interacting with the system, it becomes obvious what is meant by our arithmetic symbols.

## Potential Ways to Gamify

Cells producing energy.
Turtle moving around.

### TODO
- The programs can be "measured"
- Multiplication and Exponentiation all work
- Use NUnit for some tests
- Add shader for select MultiBlock
- Add shader for blocks as they execute

### Minor TODO
- Only one block should be selectable at a time (right now if they overlap you can grab two with one click).

### Long-Term Goals
- Implement some sort of while looping behavior
- Implement Collatz conjecture.
- Implement Universal Turing Machine.
- Implement this game inside the UTM.
- Implement x86.
